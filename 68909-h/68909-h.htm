<h2 class="nobreak">SOUPS</h2>
</div>

<h3>DIRECTIONS FOR SOUPS</h3>

<p>Iron, agate, or porcelain kettles should be used for making
soups. Meats for soups should be put to cook in cold
water, boiled gently, and the required quantity of salt
added at first, to extract the juices of the meat and cause
the scum to rise. Allow one quart of water, one teaspoon
salt for each pound of meat. Remove all scum carefully
before vegetables are added. All grease should be removed
before the vegetables are added. It is well to cook
meat the day before the soup is wanted, that the grease
may be cooled and removed easily. Grease may be easily
removed from hot soup by adding a little cold water.</p>

<p class="right"><i>Miss Ray Mayer</i></p>

<h3>GUMBO SOUP</h3>

<p>Have bouillon quantity required for family. Take giblets,
end of wings, and necks of poultry. Then add sliced
gumbo, also one tomato, one or two Chili peppers. Stew
all this for a few moments, then add little by little bouillon,
and let boil one and one-half hour. Serve soup with
a bowl of dry rice.</p>

<p class="right"><i>E. L. S.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span></p>

<h3>MOCK BISQUE SOUP</h3>

<p>One good lump of butter, one big tablespoon flour; let
this brown. Add milk as much as is needed for soup.
Now take one can of tomatoes; boil; pass through a colander;
season with salt and pepper, and sweeten with a
pinch of soda; before serving, mix with milk.</p>

<p class="right"><i>E. L. S.</i></p>

<h3>OX-TAIL SOUP</h3>

<p>Two pounds of beef and two ox tails, one large onion,
celery, two carrots, one turnip and parsley; boil in one
gallon of water for three hours, slowly but steadily; season,
strain. You may then add noodles, rice, or any other
thing you like, such as peas, dumplings, etc.</p>

<p class="right"><i>Mrs. Jake Brown</i></p>

<h3>JULIENNE SOUP</h3>

<p>Cut carrots and turnips into quarter-inch pieces the
shape of dice, also celery into thin slices, asparagus tips,
peas, and string beans cut into small uniform pieces.
Cover all this with water and season well with salt and
pepper; let cook until tender. In another saucepan have
your soup stock to boiling-point, to which add the cooked
vegetables; more seasoning if necessary. Serve hot.</p>

<p class="right"><i>Mrs. H. J. Sower</i></p>

<h3>RICE SOUP</h3>

<p>May be made with either beef or mutton stock, also by
adding all kinds of vegetables. Boil one-half cup of rice
in double boiler. Strain the soup; add the rice and let
boil one-half hour longer.</p>

<p class="right"><i>Mrs. Greenberg</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span></p>

<h3>TOMATO SOUP</h3>

<p>One can tomatoes, one teaspoon celery salt, one teaspoon
salt, sprig of parsley, one pint hot water, one onion,
one-fourth cup butter, one and one-half tablespoon flour,
one teaspoon sugar, cup milk. Boil tomatoes with onion
and water twenty minutes; heat butter and flour together;
add milk while hot; strain tomatoes into hot milk and
flour; then add all the other ingredients. Serve with
croutons or rice.</p>

<p class="right"><i>Mrs. Shipley</i></p>

<h3>OYSTER SOUP</h3>

<p>Take as much milk as you want soup. Let come to a
boil; stir in one-half cup of fine cracker meal, add one
quart of fresh oysters, a lump of butter. Let come to a
boil but once. Then remove from the fire; season with salt
and pepper; serve with oyster crackers.</p>

<p class="right"><i>Mrs. Haines</i></p>

<h3>CREAM TOMATO SOUP</h3>

<p>One-half can tomatoes, a piece of butter the size of an
egg, one-half teaspoon of saleratus or soda, two tablespoons
of cracker meal, salt to taste. Boil tomatoes one-half
hour; strain; then put on the fire, add the butter, cracker
meal, and soda. Heat one cup of milk to each plate of
soup, which pour into the tomatoes; after the soda sizzles
add salt to taste.</p>

<p class="right"><i>Mrs. Max Kohn</i></p>

<h3>NOODLE SOUP</h3>

<p>Have your soup boiling, put in desired quantity of
GOODMAN’S noodles, and boil for ten minutes uncovered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span></p>

<h3>EGG BALLS FOR SOUP</h3>

<p>Boil five eggs till hard, that is, about twenty minutes,
and then put them in cold water. Peel, cut the whites in
rings, mash the yolks with two raw yolks, add one-half a
teaspoon of salt, a few drops of onion juice, a dash of
cayenne. Form into small balls like marbles, and drop
into boiling soup two minutes before the soup is taken
off the fire; add also the rings made from the whites of
the eggs.</p>

<p class="right"><i>Mrs. A. Herz</i></p>

<h3>SUET BALLS FOR SOUP</h3>

<p>Have half a cup of suet finely chopped and freed from skin.
To this add one-half teaspoon of salt, pepper as you wish,
and half a cup of flour. Mix and add ice water, a few drops
at a time, while you stir. When you have a stiff paste, not
wet and soggy, but merely sticking together, form in little
balls like small marbles, drop in boiling soup, and cook from
five to seven minutes before serving.</p>

<p class="right"><i>Mrs. A. M. Solomon</i></p>

<h3>MEAT BALLS FOR SOUP</h3>

<p>One pound fine-chopped meat; add two eggs, salt, pepper
to taste, one onion chopped fine, parsley, bread crumbs
to keep together; fry; strain soup, and put in balls before
serving.</p>

<p class="right"><i>Miss Ray Mayer</i></p>

<h3>BREAD FINGERS FOR SOUP</h3>

<p>Cut off the crusts of stale slices of bread, cut the bread
in fingers about four inches long and three-quarters of an
inch wide; lay in a dripping-pan and toast a golden brown
in a moderate oven.</p>

<p class="right"><i>R. I. F.</i></p>

<h2 class="nobreak">FISH</h2>
</div>

<h3>THINGS WORTH KNOWING ABOUT FISH</h3>

<p>Fish that has white flesh requires about ten minutes to
the pound in boiling and fifteen minutes in baking.</p>

<p>The old idea that fish is a “brain” food was long since
proved to be without foundation, but it has not yet been
proved that an overdiet of fish does not lead to skin
troubles.</p>

<p>Never buy a fish that has dull eyes, white gills, or soft,
spongy flesh. When a fish is fresh, the eyes are bright,
the gills red and the flesh firm and odorless. Lobsters
and crabs, if alive, should be lively, or, if boiled, the
lobster’s tail should be tight against the body, not hanging
limp.</p>

<p>The proper cooking of fish is not a simple matter; if
it is underdone it is uneatable, while overdone fish is
tough and tasteless. The cooking of a fish depends upon
the size, kind, the nature of the water from which it was
taken, its character and the character of the water in which
it is cooked.</p>

<p class="right"><i>H. J. S.</i></p>

<h3>SOAKING SALT FISH</h3>

<p>By bad soaking the fish is sometimes spoiled, made
flabby and tasteless, and voted a failure, when, if properly
cooked and treated, it would be appetizing. Use cold
water or milk, and keep while soaking in a cool place.</p>

<p class="right"><i>Mrs. H. A. S.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span></p>

<h3>BROILED MACKEREL</h3>

<p>Follow the directions for soaking given in the foregoing
recipe. Wipe the fish dry; brush it lightly with olive
oil; lay it on the broiler with skin side up first, then broil
quickly. Lay on a hot platter, squeeze one-half lemon
over it and send it to the table at once. A few sprigs of
watercress or crisp red radishes go well with broiled
mackerel.</p>

<p class="right"><i>Mrs. E. F. Jones</i></p>

<h3>CODFISH BALL</h3>

<p>One cup of soft boiled potatoes mashed while hot and
fresh into half a cup of shredded codfish. Fish and potatoes
should be well mashed together, seasoned with one
tablespoon of butter and a beaten egg, dropped into a
pan of boiling-hot lard or fat, and fried until a delicate
brown. When lifted from fat, they should drain a moment
on brown paper and go to the table hot.</p>

<p class="right"><i>Mrs. A. Cooper</i></p>

<h3>CODFISH SPANISH STYLE</h3>

<p>One tablespoonful oil, onions, parsley, a little flour,
tomatoes and Chili. Fry this all together; add enough
water to make as much gravy as you wish; season to taste;
add codfish and let boil until tender.</p>

<p class="right"><i>E. L. S.</i></p>

<h3>SCHARF FISH</h3>

<p>One kitchen spoonful of lucca or olive oil. Let same
get very hot; add a chopped onion; let brown; then add<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
two tablespoonfuls of flour; also brown this. Now slowly
stir in three cups of cold water so as not to lump. When
this is stirred smoothly add chopped parsley, one toe of
garlic, salt, pepper, and a large tomato cut in quarters.
Now add your sliced fish and let boil until tender. Serve
cold.</p>

<p class="right"><i>Mrs. H. A. S.</i></p>

<h3>FISH AU GRATIN</h3>

<p>Trout, blue, or any whole fish may be used. Have
onion, garlic and parsley chopped finely together. Line
bottom of dish with cracker crumbs, parsley, etc.; put
your fish in dish and repeat the parsley, crumbs, etc.
Then pour over this one cup of white wine or sherry, one
cup of bouillon, pepper, salt, one tablespoon of Worcestershire
sauce; put small pieces of butter on top. Bake in
hot oven from thirty to forty minutes. Before serving garnish
with round slices of lemon and finely chopped parsley.</p>

<p class="right"><i>Mrs. H. A. S.</i></p>

<h3>MACKEREL WITH HACHEE SAUCE</h3>

<p>Cut fresh mackerel in pieces about three inches square;
flatten with a wet knife; place in buttered pan, season
with salt, pepper, and a little lemon juice. Cover with
buttered paper, bake ten minutes. Sauce: Mix a teaspoon
each of hashed mushrooms, small onions and parsley
in a cup of vinegar with cayenne pepper; heat until
vinegar is almost absorbed, then add four tablespoonfuls
of soup stock and the chopped mushrooms. Boil gently;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
add a tablespoonful capers, two chopped gherkins; simmer
until thick as rich cream, and lastly add a wine-glass
of sherry.</p>

<p class="right"><i>Mrs. Oppenheimer</i></p>

<h3>FILET OF SOLE À LA MOUQUIN</h3>

<p>Thoroughly wash and pick over a pound of spinach,
put it over the fire with no more water than clings to the
leaves and cook for ten minutes. At the end of that time
drain the spinach and chop it fine. Have ready thin filets
of flounders, halibut, or whitefish. Cover them with acidulated
warm water—a slice of lemon in the water is all
that is wanted—and add a slice of onion, a sprig of parsley
and a bit of bay leaf. Simmer for ten minutes and
drain. Put the minced spinach into the bottom of a buttered
baking dish, arrange the filets on it, cover with a
cream sauce to which a tablespoonful of grated cheese has
been added, and brown in the oven.</p>

<p class="right"><i>Mrs. Sam Moss</i></p>

<h3>FILETS OF HADDOCK</h3>

<p>A medium-sized fish is bought and cut in filets. Then
it is washed, dried, cut into strips, and covered for an hour
with salt, pepper, minced parsley, olive oil, and a teaspoonful
of anchovy sauce. At the end of that time the fish is
rolled in flour, then is brushed with beaten egg, dipped in
bread crumbs and rolled into little rolls tied with a thread.
The rolls are then fried in deep fat. The fish is served
with slices of lemon sprinkled with parsley.</p>

<p class="right"><i>Mrs. H. Moss</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span></p>

<h3>OYSTER CANAPÉS</h3>

<p>One cup cream, four tablespoonfuls bread crumbs, one
tablespoon butter, one pint of oysters, paprika, a little
nutmeg and salt. Boil the cream, add the bread crumbs,
then the butter. Chop the oysters fine; add oysters, then
season, add a little chopped parsley. Serve hot on buttered
toast with olives and a little gherkin.</p>

<p class="right"><i>Mrs. Joe Newman</i></p>

<h3>LOBSTER À LA AMERICAINE</h3>

<p>Boil live lobster (that has been thoroughly washed) in
the following for forty minutes: two quarts water, parsley,
onions, thyme, one bay leaf, pepper, salt. Remove lobster,
separate it, leaving meat in shell. Chop one onion,
one bay leaf, thyme, red pepper, garlic, parsley; melt one
tablespoon butter and cook the above chopped herbs until
yellow; thicken with flour, add enough water to make
plenty of sauce, pepper, and salt. Place lobster in this;
cook twenty minutes. Serve on large platter, very hot.</p>

<p class="right"><i>Mrs. L. S. Firetag</i></p>

<h3>LOBSTER À LA NEWBURG</h3>

<p>Three lobsters, one-half cup sherry, one cup of cream,
one tablespoonful butter, yolks of three eggs. Boil live
lobsters twenty minutes in salt water; when cool pick out
the meat, put it in the wine and butter, and let cook three
minutes, always stirring; then add cream, and let scald;
add salt, pepper and yolks of the eggs.</p>

<p class="right"><i>Mrs. D. Tim</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span></p>

<h3>DEVILED CRABS (FOR TWELVE)</h3>

<p>Pick twelve crabs or one can crab meat, one-half teaspoon
salt, one-half pint cream, one and one-half tablespoon
butter, one tablespoon flour, chopped parsley, a
little cayenne. Put cream into double boiler; when it is
scalded add butter and flour after it has been rubbed together
till smooth; add parsley, then crab meat; fill shells,
put bread crumbs on top, with small piece of butter. Bake
until light brown.</p>

<p class="right"><i>Mrs. Shipley</i></p>

<h3>BROWN FRICASSEE OF OYSTERS</h3>

<p>Melt one-fourth cup of butter; in this cook two slices
of onion, a sprig or two of parsley, three slices of carrot
and one-fourth of a green pepper pod cut in strips until
browned. In the meantime scald one quart of oysters
and drain carefully; cook one-third cup flour in the butter
with the vegetables until well browned; add one cup of
oyster liquor and one-half cup of cream. Stir constantly
until the sauce thickens, then strain over the drained
oysters; let heat over boiling water. Serve hot in ramequins.</p>

<p class="right"><i>Mrs. H. J. S.</i></p>

<h3>OYSTER OR LOBSTER COCKTAIL</h3>

<p>Cut the boiled lobster into cubes with a silver knife
and for each glass allow a tablespoonful of Chili sauce, a
tablespoonful of tomato catsup, a teaspoonful of lemon
juice, two teaspoonfuls of horseradish, and a few drops
of Worcestershire sauce. Serve the lobster around the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
glasses containing the sauce or in the sauce as preferred.
Use low cocktail glasses in cracked ice.</p>

<p class="right"><i>Mrs. Baum</i></p>

<h3>DRY OYSTER STEW</h3>

<p>Take six to twelve oysters, cook them in one-half pint
of their own liquor, season with salt and white pepper
and butter; cook for five minutes, stirring all the time.
Serve in bowls or soup plates.</p>

<p class="right"><i>Mrs. Marx</i></p>

<h3>BROILED OYSTERS</h3>

<p>Dry a quart of oysters in a cloth; dip each oyster in
melted butter well peppered, then in beaten egg or in
cracker crumbs; broil on a wire broiler; from three to
five minutes. Dip over each a little melted butter. Serve
hot with slices of lemon.</p>

<p class="right"><i>Mrs. Blum</i></p>

<h3>ROAST CLAMS IN SHELL</h3>

<p>Roast in a pan over a hot fire or in a hot oven. When
they crack open, empty the juice into a saucepan, add the
clams, with butter, pepper, and a little salt.</p>

<p class="right"><i>Mrs. Hirsch</i></p>

<h3>SOFT-SHELL CRABS</h3>

<p>Take out the sand-bags and pull out the spongy substance
from the sides. Wash and wipe dry; roll in
cracker meal which has been seasoned, then dip in a
beaten egg. Then have a deep frying-pan ready filled
with seething hot butter, and fry brown. Serve very hot
and garnish.</p>

<h3>ROAST SNIPE</h3>

<p>After drawing and cleaning the birds fill each one with
a piece of well-buttered bread; season with salt and pepper.
Fasten a piece of bacon around each bird, catching
it together. Place the birds in a shallow pan, and almost
cover with port wine. To this add a tablespoon of butter.

pan, with breast turned down. Cook slowly in gas
stove under the flame. Dissolve three tablespoons butter
in one-half cup water in a pie plate. When the quail are
cooking turn them in this butter every five minutes in
order to baste and make juicy. When cooked through
turn the birds over and brown the breasts. When finished
pour melted butter over them, and season with salt and
pepper. Serve hot on buttered toast.</p>

<h3>CHICKEN WITH RICE</h3>

<p>Procure a young fowl, prepare it as for fricasseeing and
put it into a pot, with a sliced onion, a red pepper cut
into pieces and salt and hot water enough to keep it
from burning. Simmer the fowl slowly for about an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
hour. Then turn in two cupfuls of canned tomatoes and
cook very slowly for another hour. At the end of that
time add a cupful of rice and cook slowly for three-quarters
of an hour longer, until the chicken is very tender and
the rice done. Season with parsley minced very fine and
serve with the meat in the centre of a platter and the rice
as a border. Care must be taken to keep the rice from
burning. Properly seasoned, the dish is a very appetizing
one.</p>

<p class="right"><i>Mrs. Silverman</i></p>

<h3>CHICKEN CURRY</h3>

<p>Chop two large onions, fry in butter till brown; add a
young chicken which has been cut in small pieces, one
tablespoon curry, three fresh tomatoes or one cup canned
tomatoes, salt and pepper to taste. Cover and let simmer
for one hour. Then add one cup milk; let boil up once.
Bank the rim of a platter with boiled rice and pour the
curry in the centre.</p>

<p class="right"><i>Mrs. Buxbaum</i></p>

<h3>ROAST TURKEY</h3>

<p>Select a fat turkey, draw, singe, and wash it. Save the
giblets; wash and clean them and put them on in water
to boil. Dress the turkey, season with salt and pepper,
and before placing in the oven pour over it hot melted
butter to close the skin. Pour in a little water and roast
about two and a half hours, basting frequently.</p>

<p>Chop the giblets when tender. Brown a little butter
and flour, add salt, pepper, the chopped giblets and the
water in which they have been cooked. To this add the
gravy in the roasting-pan and serve the whole as a gravy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span></p>

<h3>ROAST GOOSE</h3>

<p>A goose should be prepared the same as turkey, only
no butter should be used as there is always a great deal of
fat, most of which must be removed from the pan before
the water is added.</p>

<h3>ROAST DUCK</h3>

<p>Ducks require the same treatment as geese.</p>

<h3>POULTRY DRESSING</h3>

<p>Bread crumbs broken fine and seasoned with salt and
pepper, onion juice, and chopped parsley. For ducks and
geese add a little sage. Butter should be added to give
smoothness. Add two well-beaten eggs and mix thoroughly.</p>

<h3>CHICKEN CASSEROLE</h3>

<p>Cut up the chicken in portions, using liver, gizzard, and
heart also. Have a stone casserole with a cover (or a
good-sized covered saucepan). Place in the bottom of
the casserole a good-sized piece of butter, with this add
an onion or two cut in small pieces, one carrot, half a
turnip, a bit of parsley, a bit of celery top, which give a
delicious flavor. First put in butter, a few bits of the
onion, and the pieces of chicken; cook flat on the bottom
of casserole for five minutes to become a golden brown.
After all the pieces are thus browned in turn, add all the
rest of the cut-up onion, carrot, turnip, etc., and let cook<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
for twenty-five minutes over a very slow fire. The slow
fire makes it tender, cook it in its own juices; pepper
and salt each piece of chicken before placing in casserole.
Before serving add a glass of white wine or sherry. Serve
in the casserole.</p>

<p class="right"><i>Mrs. H. A. Siegel</i></p>

<h3>PRESSED CHICKEN</h3>

<p>Cook a fowl in just water enough to keep it from burning
until the meat loosens from the bones. After it has
cooled pick it to pieces and mix the light and dark meat.
Boil till hard two eggs; slice thin and add to the picked
up chicken. Boil down the water in which the chicken
was cooked till it fills a small teacup; add a little pepper,
butter and salt. Mix all with the picked up chicken; put
in a mould or bowl; put on a weight to press, and set in
a cool place. When time to serve tip the chicken on a
platter and garnish with hard-boiled eggs and watercress.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">VEGETABLES</h2>
</div>

<h3>MASHED POTATOES</h3>

<p>Peel potatoes of uniform size, cover with boiling water,
and cook until tender, salting the water in which they are
cooked when the potatoes are about half done. Drain
off the water, then with a fork or wire potato-masher beat
to a fluff in the same saucepan in which they have been
cooked. When entirely free from lumps add for every
pint of potatoes about one-third of a cup of hot milk, a
tablespoonful of butter, and salt and pepper to season.
Whip until as light as a feather. Heap in a hot dish, but
do not smooth the top; leave it piled lightly. If necessary
to keep hot for some time, set the pan containing the
potato in a saucepan of hot water, but leave uncovered
or cover lightly with a single fold of cheesecloth. Mashed
potatoes left over may be utilized in a variety of ways.
To make potato pompon take the potato up by spoonfuls
and make into balls. Roll in beaten egg, then in bread
or cracker crumbs and fry like doughnuts in hot fat. A
little minced onion, parsley, or nutmeg may be mixed with
the potato if desired; or make a potato omelet by adding
to a cupful of mashed potatoes one cup of sweet milk,
three eggs well beaten, a tablespoonful of flour, and a little
salt. Mix until smooth, turn into a heated frying-pan,
with a tablespoonful melted butter, and fry both sides,
turning when brown. Mashed potatoes left over may also
be added to shredded codfish for codfish balls, may be
mixed with well-beaten egg yolks made into flat cakes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
and fried in butter, or baked in a buttered tin in the oven,
or mixed with a little grated cheese, put into ramequins or
a buttered pudding-dish with a layer of cheese on top and
baked until brown.</p>

<p class="right"><i>Mrs. M. Harris</i></p>

<h3>SCALLOPED TOMATOES</h3>

<p>Season one can tomatoes with one teaspoonful onions,
chopped; two dashes pepper, one teaspoonful salt. Begin
by covering bottom of baking dish with bread crumbs,
spread with bits of butter and a layer of tomatoes. Follow
with a second layer of bread crumbs and tomatoes.
Cover the top with buttered crumbs and bake in oven
until a light brown.</p>

<p class="right"><i>Mrs. Niprut</i></p>

<h3>HASHED BROWN POTATOES</h3>

<p>Chop cold boiled potatoes and season them to taste with
salt, pepper, and a little onion juice. Put a couple of tablespoonfuls
of drippings in the frying-pan, turn in the potatoes,
press them into a solid cake, and cook them very
slowly until they are covered on the under side with a
brown crust. Turn them out onto a plate with the brown
side upward.</p>

<p class="right"><i>Mrs. Israel</i></p>

<h3>SUCCOTASH</h3>

<p>Cut from the cob enough green corn to fill a pint measure;
then take two-thirds of a pint of Lima beans; let
them stew in enough water to cover them. When tender
season with butter, pepper, and salt; if too thin, thicken
with flour.</p>

<p class="right"><i>Mrs. Solomon</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span></p>

<h3>SPINACH</h3>

<p>Pick over your spinach carefully and wash in several
waters. Let boil for fifteen minutes. Drain, then chop
very fine; season with salt. Put on a pan, add a little fat
or butter, rub a teaspoonful flour in same, add the spinach,
also a little soup stock. Just before serving add the beaten
egg; garnish with hard-boiled eggs.</p>

<p class="right"><i>Mrs. Hirsch</i></p>

<h3>GREEN PEAS</h3>

<p>If canned peas are used, heat, add a teaspoonful of
sugar, some chopped parsley and a teaspoonful flour to
thicken, a piece of fresh butter.</p>

<h3>CALVES’ BRAINS À LA VINAIGRETTE</h3>

<p>Wash the brains carefully in lukewarm water, rejecting
all the small membranes, then soak for an hour in cold
water to which a tablespoonful of vinegar and a good
pinch of salt have been added. Then drop into boiling
water or veal broth, seasoned with a little onion and a
blade of mace. Simmer about eighteen minutes, drain,
and serve with sauce vinaigrette. This consists of the
yolks of two hard-boiled eggs chopped and pressed through
a sieve, a tablespoonful chopped parsley, and a tablespoonful
chopped pickles, a teaspoonful shallot pressed through
a sieve, two tablespoonfuls Tarragon vinegar, four tablespoonfuls
olive oil, a teaspoonful salt, a teaspoonful dry

<h3>MINCED CHICKEN ON TOAST</h3>

<p>Have ready slices of hot toast spread with butter and
covered with a well-seasoned mixture of minced chicken
and mushrooms moistened with a little white sauce. Cut
the slices in rounds with a biscuit-cutter, and on each
place a poached egg that has also been cut round. Over

<p class="right"><i>Mrs. Leon E. Weill</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span></p>

<h3>CHICKEN TIMBALES</h3>

<p>Take the white meat of a chicken and chop very fine;
use a little cream to dampen. Heat one pint of milk, add

chicken, take from the fire, add cream, a little bread
crumbs, pepper, salt. Line the forms with truffles or
mushrooms, and fill with the mixture. Bake one-half
hour. Serve with either cream or tomato sauce.</p>

<p class="right"><i>Mrs. H. A. S.</i></p>

<h3>STUFFED PEPPERS</h3>

<p>One roasted chicken, one and one-half cup of cracker

<h3>SCALLOPED TOMATOES</h3>

<p>Pare and slice some large tomatoes. Put in a pudding-dish,
a layer of bread crumbs, season with bits of butter,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
pepper, salt, and a little sugar. Put on this a layer of
tomatoes. Repeat the process until the dish is nearly
full with tomatoes on top. Strew with bread crumbs,
cover, and bake one and one-half hour. Remove cover
and brown before serving.</p>

<p class="right"><i>Miss Ray Mayer</i></p>

<h3>TO CHOOSE AND PREPARE SWEETBREADS</h3>

<p>In picking out sweetbreads choose the larger, plumper,
and fleshier. Be careful that they are perfectly fresh; of
all meats they stand keeping least well. Rinse and put
them in lukewarm water to lie fifteen minutes, then cover
with slightly salted cold water. The sudden change of
temperature blanches them. Cut the sweetbreads apart,
cut out the pipe, and take off the skin. They are now
ready for creaming or other cooking.</p>

<p class="right"><i>Mrs. J. I. Asch</i></p>

<h3>CREAMED SWEETBREADS</h3>

<p>Carefully choose a pair of fresh sweetbreads, trim off
their fat, and follow the above directions for parboiling.
Cut them in small pieces, and simmer twenty minutes in
only enough water to make a steam. Then add a cup of
rich milk, rub smooth a tablespoon of flour and a tablespoon
of butter; moisten with some of the milk from the
saucepan, add a pinch of salt; stir all together over a
moderate fire until the flour thickens. Serve with French
peas.</p>

<p class="right"><i>Mrs. Sig. Sondheim</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span></p>

<h3>SWEETBREADS WITH OYSTERS</h3>

<p>Wash free from skin and pipes; blanch them according
to directions in foregoing recipe. Take three dozen oysters,
three pair of sweetbreads. Put the sweetbreads in
a saucepan, add the liquor from the oysters, add also
two tablespoons of butter, and set to simmer till the sweetbreads
are done. When done pour in half a cup of cream
into which a tablespoon of flour has been stirred. Bring
to a boil, drop in the oysters, and heat through or until
the edges curl.</p>

<p class="right"><i>Mrs. H. J. Sower</i></p>

<h3>SWEETBREADS WITH TOMATOES</h3>

<p>Stew a quart of tomatoes. When they are cooked put
through a sieve; you will then have a thick sauce. Have
your sweetbreads prepared according to foregoing directions.
Lay them in the tomato sauce, add salt, pepper,
and nutmeg to taste, and set over fire. As the sauce heats
add half a cup of butter into which you have stirred a
tablespoon of flour. Let the sweetbreads cook in a gentle
simmer in the tomatoes about forty minutes. Serve
on buttered toast or without, as you prefer.</p>

<p class="right"><i>Mrs. M. Lichtenstein</i></p>

<h3>FRICASSEED SWEETBREADS</h3>

<p>Cut sweetbreads into slices and let them simmer in rich
gravy for three-quarters of an hour. Add one well-beaten
egg, two tablespoonfuls of cream, and one teaspoonful of
chopped parsley. Stir all together for a few minutes and
serve immediately.</p>

nearly soft add two tablespoons of butter, red pepper, salt,
and mustard to taste; then add half a cup of cream; stir
until smooth. Add two well-beaten eggs, stir hard for a
moment. Put cover on the dish. Let mixture rest with
flame turned on for two or three seconds, then put out the
flame; leave a few seconds longer without stirring. Serve
on buttered toast. Beer or ale may be used instead of
cream or eggs.</p>

<p class="right"><i>Mrs. H. J. Sower</i></p>

<h3>FONDUE</h3>

<p>Mix together seven ounces of cheese cut fine, two ounces
of rolled cracker or bread crumbs, two ounces of softened
butter. Pour over this one pint of sweet milk which has
come to a boil, and stir. Next add yolks of three eggs
beaten and a little salt. Keep warm till dissolved, then
add beaten whites of eggs stirred in lightly with a fork.
Grease a pudding-dish, pour the mixture into this. Bake
twenty minutes in an upper oven. Serve at once.</p>

<p class="right"><i>Mrs. J. Bauman</i></p>

<h3>RAMEQUINS</h3>

<p>Beat three eggs into an ounce of melted butter, that is,
butter should be soft, not brown. Then add two ounces
of grated American cheese. Bake in small individuals

yolks. Cut a small piece from the bottom so they will
stand; put the yolks in a bowl, mash into a paste, and
season with salt, a pinch of cayenne, a little mustard, a
little sugar, vinegar, cream, and olive oil. Be careful not
to add too much vinegar. Fill the whites and pile on top.
Serve on crisp lettuce leaves with mayonnaise.</p>

<p class="right"><i>Miss H. Asch</i></p>

<h3>EGGS À LA FRANÇAISE</h3>

<p>Make a cream sauce with a small piece of butter, a
little flour, and milk. Season well. Break an egg in a
custard cup, pour the sauce over the egg and sprinkle the
top with grated Swiss cheese. Bake au bain Marie in an
even oven until a light brown.</p>

<p class="right"><i>Mrs. D. Strauss</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak">SALADS</h2>
</div>

<h3>SUGGESTIONS FOR SALADS</h3>

<p>To keep the salad-oil cruet clear and sweet add a tablespoonful
of salt to a quart of oil. The oil will not taste of
the salt, as the latter will not dissolve but will sink to and
settle at the bottom of the cruet.</p>

<p>In mixing salads the oil should be added first and thoroughly
spread before adding the other ingredients and
mixing.</p>

<p>Salads which are very moist and cooling—particularly
cucumber—should have an extra pinch of pepper added to
counteract the chilling effect on the eater’s stomach.</p>

<p>Cold string-bean salad should have a double dose of
vinegar, as beans possess in great degree the nutritious and
healthful food salts which develop to perfection in acid.</p>

<p>Whenever it is possible pure lemon juice should be substituted
for vinegar as being far more wholesome than the
latter.</p>

<p>Endive—the pale, cool, succulent, curly chiccory—salad
should be scalded and then chilled to make it more
digestible for elderly folk, children, or weak-digestioned
invalids.</p>

<h3>LOBSTER SALAD</h3>

<p>Remove the meat of a lobster, reserving the creamy fat
adhering to the body shell and coral. Shred the lobster
with a silver fork. Cut the tender white part of celery<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
into pieces the same size, allowing one-third as much as
the amount of meat. Arrange the crisp leaves of lettuce
in an oval platter with the larger green on the outer edge
decorated with the claws. Mix the meat and celery with
enough mayonnaise to moisten and heap in the centre the
coral, pounded and passed through a sieve and mixed with
remaining mayonnaise. Pile this red dressing on top and
put on ice.</p>

<p class="right"><i>Mrs. H. J. Sower</i></p>

<h3>VEGETABLE SALAD</h3>

<p>Take cold vegetables which have been boiled, such as
cauliflower, asparagus, beans, peas, and potatoes; cut
into small pieces, season well with salt, paprika, and a
little mayonnaise; serve on lettuce leaves with mayonnaise;
garnish with hard-boiled eggs; cut into quarters and olives.</p>

<p class="right"><i>Mrs. M. Wolff</i></p>

<h3>SARDINE SALAD</h3>

<p>Boil one-half a dozen eggs for half hour. Take from
fire and let stand in cold water until cold. Remove shells
and cut in half; remove yolks, put into a bowl, and rub
to a cream; add one-fourth teaspoonful dry mustard, dash
of cayenne, salt, and a little lemon juice and twelve sardines
scraped fine, after removing skin and bone. Mix
smooth and fill empty shells or halves of eggs. Cover
sides and bottom of salad dish with crisp lettuce leaves
and lay the half eggs on top with mayonnaise in the
centre.</p>

<p class="right"><i>Violet Sondheim</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span></p>

<h3>WALNUT SALAD</h3>

<p>With a silver fork rub a cream cheese and a tablespoonful
of butter to a paste, add salt and cayenne; if not soft
enough, a little sweet cream. Make into small flat balls;
on each press the two halves of an English walnut; lay on
the white heart leaves of lettuce and put on ice. On the
instant of serving pour over French dressing and serve
with thin buttered bread which has been put in the oven
and crisped.</p>

<p class="right"><i>Edna Asch</i></p>

<h3>HERRING SALAD</h3>

<p>Two herring; skin and soak until salt is out; take meat
off the bones; cut into small pieces, with one cold boiled
potato, one pickle, one-half onion, one small apple, and a
little chopped almonds. Mix well one tablespoonful vinegar,
a little water, sugar, pepper; pour into salad and mix
well. Dressing of salad: beat the milcher with a little
pepper, vinegar, and very little sugar; chop two hard-boiled
eggs, the white and yellow separate, and a little
parsley.</p>

<p class="right"><i>Mrs. S. F. Breslauer</i></p>

<h3>OYSTER SALAD</h3>

<p>Cook the oysters in their own liquor, allowing them to
boil up but once; then let get very cold, cut into small
pieces (do not chop). Cut up bits of celery and about
one-half cup of capers; add same to the cut-up oysters;
mix all with mayonnaise. Serve on lettuce leaves with
mayonnaise spread on top; garnish with olives.</p>

<p class="right"><i>Mrs. H. J. Sower</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span></p>

<h3>OYSTERS IN GRAPE-FRUIT BASKETS</h3>

<p>Cut grape-fruit so as to form a basket with handle on
one side. Scoop out the pulp and clip edge into points
with scissors. Place eight small oysters in each basket
and cover them with a sauce made of equal portions of
lemon juice, grated horseradish, tomato catsup, and speck
mustard. Place on shaved ice on plate and serve.</p>

(stirring all the time) a little less than one-half cupful
of vinegar. Stir all together. Put in double boiler and
let come gradually to a boil. Stir constantly; cook until
quite thick. Take from stove. Add dash of cayenne,
pepper and one scant tablespoon olive oil, one teaspoon
butter, and one and one-half tablespoon rich milk or
cream. Stir all together. Pour over two full teacups of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
chopped cabbage and mix. Celery makes a nice addition
when sliced thin and mixed with cabbage. Let stand few
hours before serving.</p>

<h3>TOMATO SALAD</h3>

<p>Strain one pint of tomato juice. Add one teaspoon
salt, saltspoon pepper, one teaspoon onion juice. To
this add one-fourth box gelatine. Put aside for half an
hour to dissolve. Stir all together, put on stove, let come
to a boil, take off, and pour into small cups. Set it in a
cold place to harden. Arrange two or three small lettuce
leaves on a plate, turn the tomato jelly in the centre of
the leaves, and use French or any other dressing.</p>

consistency of a soft pie dough; roll out; take suet and
spread on with a knife; fold dough, but first sprinkle with
flour. Roll again, and spread with butter quite thick;
sprinkle flour, fold again and roll; then a fourth time
roll, and spread with butter; then roll and put in dish.</p>

<p class="right"><i>Miss Ray Mayer</i></p>

<h3>PUFF PASTE</h3>

<h3>PIE CRUST</h3>

<p>One cup fat or butter, four cups flour; work fat well
into the flour until fine as sand; sprinkle over a teaspoonful
salt, and bind together with ice water. Water should

<p class="right"><i>Miss Ray Mayer</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span></p>

<h3>PREPARING FRUITS FOR PIE</h3>

<p>Apples should be peeled, sliced thin, and sugared to
taste before being put in pie crust. Peaches should also
be peeled and sugared. Raspberries, strawberries, blackberries,
cherries, and currants should be dusted with flour
as well as sweetened before being put in the crust. Gooseberries
and cranberries should be stewed and sweetened
before being put in the crust. To all fruits one to two
tablespoonfuls of water should be added. In the fruit
pie use fruit generously; that is, have plenty of the fruit
filling, which wholesomely serves as an antidote to the
rich pastry.</p>

<h3>BOSTON BROWN BREAD</h3>

<p>One cake Fleischmann’s yeast, one and three-fourths
pint water, two cups graham flour, one-half cup sifted rye
flour, two and one-half cups sifted wheat flour, one and
one-half cup sifted corn meal, one tablespoonful butter,
one teaspoonful salt, three-fourths cup molasses. Heat
one pint of the water to boiling, and pour it over the corn
meal and salt; let stand to scald a few minutes. Then
add the butter, melted, one cup of water (cold), molasses,
graham, rye, and wheat flours, and lastly the yeast, previously
dissolved in the remaining half cup of lukewarm
water; mix thoroughly; half fill well-greased baking-tins
having covers, and set to rise for about two hours, or until
within an inch of the top. Then grease and put on covers,
and bake in moderate oven for three hours and a half;
take off covers and bake for another half hour. This
recipe, carefully followed, makes the original Boston
brown bread. An ordinary three-pound lard-pail makes
a good baking-tin for this purpose. This recipe makes
sufficient for two pails. The entire process takes about
six hours.</p>

<p class="right"><i>Mrs. Shipley</i></p>

<h3>ENTIRE-WHEAT BREAD</h3>

<p>One cake Fleischmann’s yeast, one cup lukewarm
water, one cup lukewarm milk, three pints entire-wheat
flour, two teaspoonfuls sugar, one teaspoonful salt. Put<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
milk, salt, and sugar into bowl; add to it water in which
the yeast has previously been dissolved. Then add the
flour gradually, reserving a little for use in kneading.
This dough should be kneaded thoroughly, but must be
kept soft. After kneading set in a warm place to rise for
from two to two and one-half hours. When light, turn
out on a floured kneading-board, divide into two equal
parts and knead again thoroughly. Place in well-greased
pans and set to rise for from three-quarters of an hour to
an hour. When well risen bake for one hour in a slower
oven than is required for white bread. After bread is
baked, remove from pans, and cool by contact with the
air on all sides. One tablespoonful of butter may be
added with the sugar, if desired. If set over night, use
one-half cake of yeast. In summer, use the liquid cold;
in winter, tepid. The entire process takes four hours.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>—Entire-wheat bread may be made by following
any good bread recipe and substituting whole-wheat flour
for the ordinary wheat flour.</p>

<p class="right"><i>Mrs. Shipley</i></p>

<h3>WHITE BREAD—QUICK METHOD</h3>

dissolve the salt and sugar. Mix thoroughly the water
containing the yeast, salt, and sugar, then stir in gradually
three quarts of the flour. Now work in the lard or butter,
and make a moderately stiff dough. Knead well for ten<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>
or fifteen minutes; then set aside in a warm place, free
from draught, to rise until light, which will be in from
two to two and a half hours. Cover with cloth or paper
to prevent crust forming on top. When light, make into
loaves with the hand, place in well-greased pans and set
to rise again for forty-five minutes. When light, bake in
a hot oven for from three-quarters of an hour to an hour.
The extra pint of flour will be needed to keep kneading-board
well floured while kneading and forming into loaves.
This makes three one-and-one-half pound loaves. The
whole process takes about four hours. Half milk and
half water may be used instead of all water, if a richer
loaf is desired. Young housekeepers who have never
done any baking have been eminently successful by following
this recipe.</p>

<p class="right"><i>Mrs. J. T. Asch</i></p>

<h3>CRANBERRY CATSUP</h3>

<p>Cook together ten pounds of berries, one quart of vinegar,
five pounds of brown sugar, three tablespoons of cinnamon,
two of allspice, one tablespoon each of salt and
cloves, and one-fourth of a teaspoon of cayenne. Boil

<p class="right"><i>Mrs. A. Rosenthal</i></p>

<h3>PICKLED CAULIFLOWER</h3>

<p>Wash, soak, and take off the leaves of the cauliflower.
Break the flowers into small twigs. Parboil the twigs in
brine, drain, lay in a crock, and pour over boiling spiced
vinegar.</p>

<p class="right"><i>Mrs. Kaufman</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span></p>

<h3>BRANDIED CHERRIES</h3>

<p>Have perfectly ripe and sound sweet cherries. Keep
stems by cutting short. Drop the cherries a few at a
time in a boiling syrup made of one pint of water and
one-half pound of sugar. When they have boiled three
to five minutes, lift out and lay on plates; allow to cool
and dry as they cool. They should be perfect in form.
Make a second syrup twice as sweet as the first; use a
pound of sugar to a pint of water. When syrup boils
clear, set aside to cool. Carefully pack the cherries in
glass jars. To the cool second syrup add the same amount
of the best brandy. Pour the mixed syrup and brandy
over the cherries in the jars, seal, set in cool fruit-closet.
Other fruits may be brandied by this recipe.</p>

<p class="right"><i>Mrs. H. J. Sower</i></p>

<h3>MIXED MARMALADE</h3>

<p>Crush two and one-half pounds of currants and pitted
cherries, add two pounds of seeded raisins, the yellow
peel of four oranges chopped fine, and three pounds of
sugar. Cook gently till the fruit is a marmalade, adding
a little water if needed; add the juice of the oranges just
before the marmalade is ready to leave the stove. Cook
ten minutes after putting in the juice.</p>

<p class="right"><i>Miss E. Asch</i></p>

<h3>CRANBERRY JELLY</h3>

<p>Two quarts cranberries. Soak over night, then take
water to cover; boil and strain; to each pint of juice one
pound of sugar, let boil down, put in wet moulds, and
let stand twenty-four hours.</p>

<p class="right"><i>Miss Ray Mayer</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span></p>

<h3>SPICED PEARS</h3>

<p>Take two teaspoons of whole cloves, one tablespoon of
allspice, one tablespoon of cinnamon. Crush them slightly
and boil one minute in a quart of vinegar and a pint of
sugar mixed. Take a fine variety of pear, halve, take
out seeds, boil in water until tender, finish the cooking
in the spiced syrup, cooking not too soft. Place in small
stone jars and cover well with syrup. Tie a cover over
the jar. Spiced peaches are made the same, except do
not cook first in water. The syrup will cook them sufficiently.</p>

<p class="right"><i>Mrs. B. B. L.</i></p>

<h3>BOILED CHESTNUTS WITH PRUNES</h3>

<p>Scald the chestnuts. Heat a little goose-grease, put in
the chestnuts with a few prunes and an onion, a little
cinnamon, considerable water, and let boil until tender,
then stir in a little sugar, flour, and vinegar, and let boil.</p>

<p class="right"><i>Miss Ray Mayer</i></p>

<h3>TUTTI-FRUTTI</h3>

<p>One quart best alcohol, equal amount fruit and sugar;
that is, one pineapple cut in small pieces, four large
oranges, four lemons (both peeled). These cut into slices
or small pieces; weigh, and the same amount of sugar,
add alcohol. Uncooked other fruits, such as strawberries,
cherries (pitted), plums, apricots, peaches, may be added;
always use as much fruit as sugar. Put in a large stone
jar. Mix as different fruits are added. By Christmas it
will be fine. This is fine added to grape-fruit during the
winter, and as a rich dessert served over ice-cream.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">SANDWICHES</h2>
</div>

<h3>CREAM CHEESE AND RIPE OLIVES</h3>

<p>Stone and chop the olives fine and beat in with a little
cream or Neufchâtel cheese, adding sweet cream to moisten
and salt and paprika to season. Green olives or pimentoes
may be used in the same way. Spread on slices of whole-wheat
or brown bread and press together.</p>

<h3>NUT-AND-CHEESE SANDWICHES</h3>

<p>Mix with a half roll cream or Neufchâtel cheese a quarter
cup chopped or pounded nuts. Add salt and pepper to
season and spread.</p>

<h3>CREAM CHEESE, CURRANT JELLY, AND NUTS</h3>

<p>Blend cream cheese with a spoonful currant jelly and
spread one slice of bread with this. Spread a second slice with
chopped nuts, and press together.</p>

<h3>OTHER CREAM CHEESE COMBINATIONS</h3>

<p>Among those frequently noticed and used are cream
cheese and crisp lettuce leaves, cream cheese and sliced
tomatoes, cheese and chopped dates or figs, cheese and
chopped spinach, seasoned with lemon juice and mayonnaise,
cheese and the yolks of hard-boiled eggs rubbed
through a sieve, cheese and sliced cucumber, cheese and
minced preserved pineapple, cheese and preserved ginger.</p>

<p class="right"><i>Mrs. H. J. Sower</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span></p>

<h3>PRESERVED-GINGER SANDWICHES</h3>

<p>Chop preserved ginger very fine, moisten with some of
the syrup of cream to a consistency for spreading and put
between small rounds of bread.</p>

<h3>EGG SANDWICHES</h3>

<p>Remove the yolks of two hard-boiled eggs and rub
smooth. Season with a little salt, paprika, mustard, and
lemon juice or vinegar to stiffen. Mayonnaise is still better.
Add the chopped whites and spread between slices
of buttered bread.</p>

<h3>TONGUE-AND-TOMATO SANDWICHES</h3>

<p>Cut tongue in delicate slices, or mince fine, and place with
thin slices of raw tomato seasoned with salt and pepper, between
thin rounds of buttered bread.</p>

<h3>OYSTER SANDWICHES</h3>

<p>Cook the oysters in their liquor about two minutes, stir
into a stiff mayonnaise and spread between slices of sandwich
bread. Another way to make these hearty yet dainty
sandwiches is to fry large oysters, placing one between
bread slices.</p>

<h3>SANDWICH À LA MARS</h3>

<p>Take equal quantities of almonds and walnuts and
chop them fine. Moisten with a little French dressing,
then spread on thin slices of buttered bread. Add a crisp
leaf of lettuce to each slice, cover with the other buttered
slice, press together gently, trim off the brown crust and
cut diagonally in two.</p>

<p class="right"><i>Mrs. William Reinstein</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span></p>

<h3>CELERY SANDWICH</h3>

<p>Chop and then pound to a paste the yolks of five hard-boiled
eggs, a small piece of butter, a little salt, a teaspoonful
of anchovy sauce, a teaspoonful of curry powder, a
teaspoonful of bread crumbs, and a tablespoonful of
French dressing. The paste should have the consistency
of butter. Spread it between thin slices of buttered bread,
placing a lettuce leaf in each sandwich. Trim and cut in
the usual manner.</p>

<h3>FISH SANDWICHES</h3>

<p>Any cooked fresh fish picked into bits, well seasoned
with salt and pepper and moistened with mayonnaise,
makes an excellent filling for a sandwich. A little chopped
pickle is also an addition.</p>

<h3>NASTURTIUM SANDWICHES</h3>

<p>These are dainty and appetizing. Cut your bread in
thin slices, and butter. Take nasturtium leaves or blossoms
that have been laid in cold water a few moments to
crisp, sprinkle with salt, bruise lightly with a wooden
spoon, and place between the slices of buttered bread.</p>

<h3>LETTUCE SANDWICHES</h3>

<p>An entire leaf of lettuce is seldom used nowadays in a
sandwich. Instead the leaf is cut into ribbons with scissors,
put between thin slices of white bread, well buttered,
and seasoned with mayonnaise, French dressing or salt
only as preferred. Lettuce should be crisp before using.</p>

<p class="right"><i>Mrs. William Reinstein</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span></p>

<p>A delicious sandwich is made by creaming together
equal parts of American cheese and butter, seasoning it
well with paprika, spreading it on bread, and sprinkling
the layer with minced watercress.</p>

<p>A tasty picnic sandwich is spread with cress, a few thin
slivers of Spanish onion, and a trace of horseradish for
zest. Carry these sandwiches in a box by themselves or
they will flavor the entire luncheon.</p>

<p>For tasty sandwiches, rub the green part of Roquefort
cheese to a cream with butter; add salt and a dash of
paprika, moisten with olive oil and spread between very
thin slices of bread. Serve on lettuce leaves.</p>

<p>Cold-lamb sandwiches—very thin slices of the meat
nicely salted between thin slices of bread—are appetizing
for a picnic luncheon. If a glass of currant jelly goes
along they will be more popular, however.</p>

<p>Cucumber, green pepper, and lettuce minced and moistened
with mayonnaise make a delicious sandwich filling.</p>

<p>Cream cheese and sliced olives moistened with mayonnaise
are an excellent filling for thin-brown-bread sandwiches.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">BEVERAGES</h2>
</div>

<h3>GRAPE WINE</h3>

<p>Pick grapes from stems, wash, and put through sieve.
Then take pulps and skins, pour on as much water as you
wish wine, and let stand a few days to ferment; then
strain. Pour this water on juice and let stand ten to
twelve days to work. Then remove the foam. Take to
one gallon two pounds sugar. Place in jug and let ferment.</p>

<p class="right"><i>Miss Ray Mayer</i></p>

<h3>CHERRY SYRUP</h3>

<p>Have ripe, juicy, acid cherries; stone them and pound
and break one-eighth of the stones. Cook all together
until cherries are soft and juice free. Squeeze through a
bag. To every pint of juice add one heaping cup of sugar;
let boil fifteen minutes. Put in bottles or jars; seal for
use. Keep in a cool place.</p>

<p class="right"><i>Mrs. P. Levy</i></p>

<h3>CIDER CUP</h3>

<p>One quart of cider, two bottles of soda water, one bottle
of lemonade, one heaping tablespoonful of granulated
sugar, a sprig of mint, and two inches of cucumber. Cut
the cucumber into slices without peeling it. Place it in a
pitcher with the sugar, cider, and mint. Allow it to stand,
on ice if possible, for two hours. Then add the lemonade
and soda water and a few pieces of ice, removing the mint.</p>

<p class="right"><i>H. J. S.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span></p>

<h3>CIDER CUP</h3>

<p>Have in a pitcher cracked ice. Over the ice pour a
quart of sweet cider and a bottle of club soda; drop in a
few pieces of mint, and, if you have them, a few thin slices
of such fruits as bananas, apples, pears, etc. Serve at
once.</p>

<p class="right"><i>Mrs. E. O. G.</i></p>

<h3>EGG-NOG</h3>

<p>Beat the yolk of one egg very light; add one wine-glass
of whiskey drop by drop until the egg is cooked; next put
in one tablespoonful of rum, one glass of rich milk or
cream, and last the white of the egg beaten to a stiff froth.
Nutmeg to taste.</p>

<p class="right"><i>Mrs. H. J. Sower</i></p>

<h3>GINGER PUNCH</h3>

<p>Chop one pound of ginger, then add two cups of sugar,
and one pint of water. Boil together fifteen minutes.
When cool add one cup of orange juice and strain. This
will flavor eight or ten cups of water.</p>

<p class="right"><i>Mrs. A. Horwich</i></p>

<h3>STRAWBERRY PUNCH</h3>

<p>Stem one quart of ripe strawberries, crush them with
half a pint of raspberries, and strain the juice through a
sieve. Make a syrup with two cupfuls of sugar and one and
a half cupfuls of water. Mix with the juice and syrup a
large glass of port wine and keep on ice for several hours.
Serve in small glasses with lady-fingers.</p>

<p class="right"><i>H. J. S.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span></p>

<h3>MILK PUNCH</h3>

<p>To a pint of new milk add two tablespoonfuls of sugar.
Stir and dissolve the sugar; lastly add two tablespoons of
wine.</p>

<p class="right"><i>Mrs. M. Soloman</i></p>

<h3>CURRANT WATER</h3>

<p>One pound of ripe red currants, half a pound of lump
sugar, half a pound of granulated sugar, and six cupfuls
of water. Stalk and pick over the currants, then mash
them with a wooden spoon, adding as you do so one cupful
of water. Now put the fruit into a preserving-pan
with the granulated sugar. Stir it over the fire until it
begins to simmer, then rub it through a sieve. Put the
lump sugar into a saucepan with one and a half cupfuls of
boiling water; let the sugar dissolve slowly, then boil it
to a syrup; pour this onto the fruit juice, adding one and
a half pints more water. Serve cold.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CANDY</h2>
</div>

<h3>TAFFY</h3>

<p>One cup molasses, one cup granulated sugar, piece of
butter size of an egg, teaspoon vinegar, pinch bi-carbonate
soda, peanuts, cocoanuts, or nuts of any kind may be
added to this. Boil molasses, sugar, butter, and vinegar
together until same cracks in cold water. When nearly finished,
add soda and nuts; pour in buttered pan.</p>

<p class="right"><i>E. L.</i></p>

<h3>BUTTER TAFFY</h3>

<p>Two cups of white sugar, three-fourths cup of vinegar
(not too strong), three-fourths cup of butter. Boil until
brittle; pour into buttered pan.</p>

<p class="right"><i>Miss Ray Mayer</i></p>

<h3>CHOCOLATE CREAMS</h3>

<p>Dip plain creams shaped from fondant into melted
sweet chocolate and they become chocolate creams. This
dipping must be done quickly. Nothing is better for
holding the creams while dipping than a long hat-pin.
Place on oiled paper to harden.</p>

<p class="right"><i>Mrs. H. Goodman</i></p>

<h3>RAW FONDANT</h3>

<p>The white of one egg, add an equal quantity of ice
water (this may be exactly ascertained if the white of
egg is first measured in a glass); one teaspoon of extract.
Beat until the mixture is light, then add gradually one
pound or more of confectioner’s XXX sugar. Work with
a spoon until smooth and firm.</p>

<p class="right"><i>Mrs. Hirschberg</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span></p>

<h3>COOKED FONDANT</h3>

<p>Place over the fire four cups of XXX sugar, one cup of
water. Stir with a wooden spatula until the sugar is dissolved—no
longer. Boil ten minutes or until it threads.
Remove saucepan. Test the fondant by rubbing a little
between the fingers. If it balls, turn into a bowl. When
partly cooked, add flavoring; then beat until stiff enough
to knead with the hands like bread. The fondant may be
shaped into balls, squares, or any form. A little experience
will enable one to do this readily. If vegetable
colorings, which are harmless, be used, the French candies
may be more perfectly imitated. For flavoring use extracts
or fruit juice.</p>

<p class="right"><i>Mrs. M. Soloman</i></p>

<h3>NOUGAT</h3>

<p>To make the most delectable of candies, melt over the
fire in a porcelain-lined dish one pound of fine white sugar
with two tablespoons of water. Have ready one-half a
pound of almonds blanched and chopped. When the
syrup begins to turn yellow, add the nuts. Stir for five
minutes; add a little grated lemon peel and pour at once
into a well-oiled flat pan. When partly cooled, mark with
a greased knife into bars.</p>

<p class="right"><i>Mrs. J. H. Sower</i></p>

<h3>PEANUT CANDY</h3>

<p>Melt slowly in a saucepan one pound of heavy wet
brown sugar; add no water. Shell one quart of freshly
roasted peanuts and chop them a little. When the sugar
is cooked to a thick syrup, shake a little salt over the peanuts,
and stir them in. Pour in shallow buttered tins, and
let cool.</p>

</div>

<h3>ITEMS OF INTEREST AND VALUE</h3>

<p>There is nothing like spring sunshine for bringing
out scratches and blemishes on the furniture and
marks of wear and tear on carpets and upholstery.
Possibly the housekeeper’s eye is quickened by the
approach of housecleaning paraphernalia, but certain
it is that the room that has worn a respectable air
through the winter with the first ardent glance of old
Sol will suddenly reveal no end of defects. For restoring
furniture there are several excellent preparations
to be found in the market, and nearly every
housekeeper has her own preference among them.
With one of the good oil polishes, a soft cloth, and
plenty of what is popularly known as “elbow-grease,”
very obstinate scratches will disappear. A vigorous
rubbing with a clean flannel cloth should follow the
application of the preparation in all cases.</p>

<p>A mixture of oil and turpentine is the best of restoratives
for wood that has become grimy and dull.
The usual formula is three parts of paraffine oil to
one part of turpentine. Be sure that all dust is removed
before the work begins. Moisten a flannel<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>
cloth in the mixture, and apply it to all parts of the
wood. In obstinate cases let the preparation remain
on the wood for a time then dust with rottenstone,
moisten again with oil and rub quickly after the oil
is applied. Do not let the rottenstone become dry, or
it will still further blemish the wood. When the work
with the rottenstone and oil is over, follow it up with
rubbings with a clean, soft cloth and then with a polishing
with the oil and turpentine described above. There
is no objection to mixing the rottenstone and oil in a
dish before the work begins.</p>

<p>To clean furniture that may have come from the
second-hand store or store-room, where it has been
badly soiled, make a mixture of beeswax and kitchen
soap—an ounce of the wax to a quarter of a pound
of the soap. Dissolve the two together over the fire
and then stir in half an ounce of sal-soda. Stir the
mixture until it is cold and then mix with it an equal
part of turpentine. A little of this on a soft cloth
will work wonders with old furniture.</p>

<p>The dark fumed oak of the Mission and other popular
furniture shapes sometimes gets marred below
its stain. In such cases common oil paints sold to
amateurs for 10 cents and 5 cents a tube may be rung
into service. Burnt umber and lampblack will give
the fumed-oak shade. Drop the umber in a saucer
and mix to the desired shade with lampblack, thinning
with linseed oil. Burnt sienna and lampblack toned
with yellow ochre will give mahogany color. Burnt
sienna, burnt umber, lampblack, and yellow ochre
mixed in the right proportions give black-walnut<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>
tone. Burnt sienna is about the color of cherry. Raw
umber will answer for most light woods such as ash,
oak, and maple. Use brush or cloth in putting on
the colors, according to convenience.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Natural finished willow furniture may be cleaned
with soapsuds in which borax has been dissolved.
It should be applied with a scrubbing-brush. The
pieces should be dried very speedily in the sun. Before
the cleaning with water begins, the piece should
be thoroughly dusted. This rule holds good with
any article at all that is being washed. All loose dust
should be shaken or brushed off or out before water
is applied.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Natural wood should be freed from all loose dust before
cleaning and then may be wiped off with a woollen
cloth moistened with oil and turpentine or with wood
alcohol. This treatment should be followed by a
rubbing with a dry woollen cloth to bring out the polish.
A woman who found several dents in the hardwood
of her dining-room wainscoting restored it by laying
over each dent a thick pad of wet brown paper, a wet
cloth folded several times over that, and then applying
a hot iron over all. When the pad was about dry
it was removed, and if the place still showed a mar
the treatment was repeated.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>One housekeeper who is successful in keeping her
furniture in polish washes the varnished-wood frames
twice a year with potato water and then rubs them<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>
dry and bright with woollen cloths. The piano receives
the same treatment. The potato water is prepared
by soaking uncooked potatoes sliced thin in
cold water for two or three hours and then straining
the water.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>An old housekeeper who has several choice Oriental
rugs, some of light color, sees to the cleaning of
them herself. They are first swept thoroughly on both
sides on the grass of the back yard. Then, if they
are light-colored, they are covered with cornstarch
which has a small mixture of prepared chalk, and are
left for several hours. At the end of that time they
are brushed free from the powder, shaken well and
beaten carefully. Dark ones are covered with hardwood
sawdust and left over night. The next day they
are swept with a stiff clean broom, and then wiped
off with a towel wrung out of hot water.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The silver desk furnishings, vases, etc., will retain
their gloss with little extra cleaning if they are polished
with a piece of soft silk several times a week.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Silver should always be thoroughly washed after
any cleansing powder or liquid is used on it.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>To clean copper kettles, rub the kettle with a cut
lemon dipped in powdered bath brick. When all
stains are removed, wash in warm soapy water; then
dry and polish with powdered bath brick and a soft
cloth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>To polish brass trimmings, such as hinges, handles,
and other ornaments of furniture, without marring
the wood during the work requires that the polish shall
be beneficial to the wood as well as to the metal. A
mixture of half as much naphtha as paraffine oil and
enough powdered rottenstone to make a soft, thick
cream will accomplish the purpose. It should be
applied with wool and should be followed by a rubbing
with a soft cloth. Before polishing the last time
it is well to make an application of dry rottenstone
powder to remove all traces of the naphtha. Unless
this is done, the brass will tarnish soon.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>White wax packed with white silk or satin will
keep the material from yellowing. It is an old custom
to put away the wedding gown in this way.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>To take out a blood-stain, cover the spot with cold
raw starch, just wet enough to make a paste, and
leave it until it is dry.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>To remove wine-stains, spread the blemished fabric
over a bowl and pour boiling salt water through it from
a height.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Machine oil should be washed out in cold water
before the article stained with it goes to the laundress.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Javelle water is an antidote for iron rust.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Valuable plaster casts are best cleaned by professional
plaster-workers. Small pieces that have become<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>
soiled may be made more sightly by covering
them with whiting and fuller’s earth, wrapping them
in a cloth and leaving them for two or three days.
When the powder is brushed off much of the grime
will go with it.</p>

<h3>TO PREVENT BREAKING GLASS</h3>

<p>In opening a jar of fruit with a knife always insert
the blade between jar and rubber. Prying against
the thin edge of the cover bends it out of shape, perhaps
ruining it for future use, and is likely to break the
glass.</p>

<h3>TO CUT PLATE GLASS</h3>

<p>To cut a piece of plate glass it is thought a diamond-cutter
is necessary, but it is not. If the glass is not
very thick it can be cut with a pair of scissors, a large
pair being preferable. While cutting hold the glass
beneath half a foot or more of water, and it can be
readily cut any shape desired. A round piece of glass
has been cut out of a good-sized pane in just this
manner. The scissors do not have to be extra sharp.</p>

<p class="right">“<i>Success.</i>”</p>

<h3>TO REMOVE FRUIT-STAINS</h3>

<p>Stained table linen follows the return of the fresh-fruit
season as surely “as night follows day.” For removing
such stains there is nothing more effective than the
sulphur bleach. Lay a spoonful of sulphur on a plate,
and sprinkle with a few drops of alcohol. Over this
place a tin funnel with the point upward. Touch a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>
lighted match to the alcohol; wet the stained linen, and
hold the spot over the opening in the point of the
funnel. The sulphur fumes will remove the most
obstinate stain, seldom requiring more than one application.
Rinse and wash the linen at once, to prevent
rotting the material.</p>

<h3>SICKLY PLANTS</h3>

<p>Nitrate of soda will rapidly improve the appearance
of house plants that have become sickly. A piece
about the size of a marble is enough for a plant taking
a twelve-inch pot.</p>

<h3>TO KILL INSECTS</h3>

<p>A good solution to kill all insects is to take two
pounds of alum and dissolve it in three or four quarts
of boiling water; let it stand on the stove until the
alum is all melted, then apply it with a brush while
very hot to the wainscoting and floor and wherever
the vermin abound.</p>

<p>It is also good to use on pantry shelves and bedsteads,
and is a sure cure for the pests of fleas that are apt to
swarm a closed house after a damp spell in the summer
time.</p>

<h3>FINE DARNING</h3>

<p>In darning a shirtwaist or other garment where it
is important that the place shall not be seen, do the
work without putting a piece under the hole and use
very fine thread. If the darning is done well, the spot<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>
will be as strong as the fabric around it and when it
is ironed will be scarcely noticeable. The edges of
the material, of course, must be drawn together in their
original position. In mending any fabric, the direction
of the threads should follow, as much as possible,
the lines of the warp and woof. It is advisable sometimes
to ravel a thread from the fabric itself and use
it in darning. At other times, when silk is to be used,
it is well to split silk in order to have a flat thread
instead of a round one. It is an old-fashioned idea
worth remembering to use a hair in darning fine wool.</p>

<h3>THE SAND-BAG AS A WARMER</h3>

<p>A sand-bag as a warmer is said to be greatly superior
to a hot-water bottle, which many people prize
so highly. Get some clean, fine sand; dry it thoroughly;
make a bag about eight inches square of flannel,
fill it with dry sand, sew the opening carefully together,
and cover the bag with cotton or linen cloth. This
will prevent the sand from sifting out, and also enable
any one to heat the bag quickly by placing it in an oven
or on top of a stove. The sand holds the heat for a long
time.</p>

<p class="right">“<i>Health.</i>”</p>

<h3>USES FOR TURPENTINE</h3>

<p>There are few housekeepers who are not familiar
with some of the numerous uses of turpentine, and
as its odor is clean and wholesome it has the advantage
over many remedies whose odors are offensive.</p>

<p>Turpentine and soap will remove ink-stains from
linen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span></p>

<p>A few drops added to water in which clothes are boiled
will whiten them.</p>

<p>It will exterminate roaches if sprinkled in their
haunts.</p>

<p>Turpentine will remove wheel-grease, pitch, and tar.</p>

<p>A few drops on a woollen cloth will clean tan shoes
nicely.</p>

<p>Clean gilt frames with a cloth moistened in turpentine.</p>

<p>Carpets can be cleaned and colors restored by going
over occasionally with a broom dipped in warm water
in which a little turpentine is added.</p>

<p>An equal mixture of turpentine and linseed oil will
remove white marks from furniture caused by water.</p>

<h3>THINGS TO AVOID</h3>

<p>Avoid biting the thread; it is harmful to the teeth.</p>

<p>Never leave matches where rats can get at them.</p>

<p>To remove ink-stains from clothing, soak the spot
in sour milk.</p>

<p>Salt and vinegar will be found excellent for scouring
copper kettles.</p>

<p>Keep an oyster shell in your tea kettle to prevent
the forming of crust.</p>

<p>Delicate glass can be safely washed in very hot water
if slipped in edgewise.</p>

<p>Fill vases one-fourth full of sand to prevent them
from being knocked over and broken.</p>

<p>A little powdered charcoal put in the sink occasionally
will keep it clean and free from odors.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span></p>

<p>Rubbing chilblains thoroughly with paraffine oil
every night for a week is said to effect a cure.</p>

<p>A little kerosene added to the water with which
you wash your windows will make them much brighter.</p>

<p>A few drops of oil of lavender poured into a glass
of hot water and set in the sick-room will purify it
greatly.</p>

<p>Soaking new brooms in strong hot salt water before
using them is said to toughen the bristles, making the
brooms more durable.</p>

<h3>IN CASE OF FIRE</h3>

<p>If smoke is seen pouring out from under a door,
do not rush and open that door. Remember that by
so doing you cause a draught which will fan smouldering
timbers into flame. Shut and keep shut all
doors and windows, or other air-channels.</p>

<p>If you have not a hand pump or fire grenades handy,
collect as many pails or jugs of water as possible outside
the closed door of the room which is afire.</p>

<p>Meantime, remember that smoke is almost as dangerous
to life as fire. A soaking-wet towel knotted
round the face and nostrils is an excellent rough-and-ready
protection against breathing smoke. So is a
wet sponge.</p>

<p>Remember also that smoke rises. Therefore, it is
least thick near the floor. If the smoke be very thick,
crawl with your face close against the floor.</p>

<p>The commonest cause of fire is the upsetting of
an oil lamp. Water will only spread the flames of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>
burning oil, but a hearth-rug will extinguish them
promptly, says “Home Chat.”</p>

<p>Milk will also extinguish burning oil.</p>

<p>Sand or earth or common salt are useful aids to fire-fighting.
The contents of an ordinary flower-pot will
stop the spread of the flames of oil.</p>

<h3><span class="large">WOMAN</span></h3>

<p>It takes a hundred men to make an encampment,
but one woman can make a home. I not only admire
woman as the most beautiful creature that was ever
created, but I reverence her as the redeeming glory of
humanity, the sanctuary of all the virtues, the pledge
of all perfect qualities of heart and head. It is not just
nor right to lay the sins of men at the feet of woman.
It is because women are so much better than men, that
their faults are considered greater. A man’s desire is
the foundation of his love, but a woman’s desire is born
of her love. The one thing in this world that is constant,
the one peak that arises above all clouds, the one
window in which the light forever burns, the one star
that darkness cannot quench, is woman’s love. It rises
to the greatest height, it sinks to the lowest depths, it
forgives the most injuries. It is perennial of life and
grows in every climate. Neither coldness nor neglect,
harshness nor cruelty, can extinguish it. A woman’s
love is the perfume of the heart. This is the real love
that subdues the earth; the love that has wrought all
miracles of art; that gives us music all the way from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>
the cradle song to the grand closing symphony that
bears the soul away on wings of fire. A love that is
greater than power, sweeter than life, and stronger than
death.—<i>Robert G. Ingersoll.</i></p>

<h3>A WOMAN’S HOUSEWORK AS A PHYSICAL-CULTURE
SCHOOL</h3>

<p>America possesses thousands of girls who find a
large part of their physical culture to perfection in
“helping mother,” and they are not blushing because
they do so. For them the vista of possibilities is long
and alluring.</p>

<p>For the arms, fingers, and wrists, they find washing
and wiping dishes admirable; perhaps water helps
to make supple the joints, which is an advantage
that dish-washing has over the drying. However,
there is a fine elbow movement in the wiping, too.</p>

<p>Bed-making is still taught in the homely physical
economics and cannot be too highly recommended.
With the folding of the counterpane and sheets, the
arms are stretched to their utmost, and while standing
erect, with chest thrown out, breathing is bound to
be correct.</p>

<p>Shoulder, torso, and limbs are developed in mattress-lifting,
but it requires a strong woman to do this
easily; any hint of spinal affection is an embargo
on the exercise.</p>

<p>Sweeping gives much the same motion as is used
in handling golf-clubs. For perfection of arms and
shoulders there is nothing better.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>Scrubbing, like lawn tennis, is rather violent and
not to be attempted unless one is sure of the heart.
In the beginning it will be as severe on the knees as
is paddling a canoe, but so soon as one becomes familiar
with the work it affords a subtle satisfaction all
its own.</p>

<p>Running up and down stairs when mother needs
anything is a first-class exercise; and an interesting
diversion, as well as an upper-arm developer, may
be found in egg-beating.</p>

<p>Dusting should have a chapter by itself. First
you are down on all fours, then on tiptoe to see how
far the cloth will reach. The tiptoeing for calf-development
is superb.</p>

<p>You twist yourself into all sorts of positions to get
at the corners of the carved furniture. You are on
one knee, then on the other. Every muscle, every
tendon is brought into service before you have finished.</p>

<h3>KEEP YOUNG</h3>

<p>A beautiful woman, who combines in her person a
greater number of charms than do most fascinating
women, gives her formula for keeping young and
handsome in spite of a life of constant study, hard
work, and comparatively no play: “Vigilance and
determination and perhaps a little self-sacrifice are
the price I pay for being considered a good-looking
woman,” she says.</p>

<p>Remember, this beauty can act and is entitled to
be called a star of the first magnitude. “I am ever<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>
on the alert and when I discover traces of fatigue or
any destroying symptoms, I set about at once to eradicate
them. During the theatrical season I don’t attempt
to be anything but a professional woman. I
don’t receive, nor do I go to other people’s houses.
I simply haven’t the time and I don’t make it.</p>

<p>“My mode of life is very simple. As a rule I sleep
nine or ten hours out of the twenty-four, never less
than eight. I eat regularly and avoid everything that
will give me indigestion. You know that indigestion
is one of beauty’s most powerful foes, a greater enemy
than age, as great even as worry.</p>

<p>“I walk every day, rain or shine, wear a short skirt
and low-heeled shoes. I keep the French heels for
the stage. I try not to worry, no matter what happens,
and never tire myself unnecessarily. My method
has no frills or isms; perhaps few women would care
to try it. As Turkish baths agree with me, I am
devoted to them, and I consider a good complexion
cream as important, almost, as cold water.”</p>

<p>On Sunday, she explained, she was not obliged
to go to the theatre. “Yet I do not spend that day
in idleness nor in receiving visitors. When one’s hair is
five feet long and very thick, it is not an easy task to
have it shampooed, so I am almost ashamed to confess
the entire day is quite given over to self-preservation.</p>

<p>“How do I keep the same weight all the time?
Why, by vigilance, determination, and a good pair
of scales frequently consulted. If I gain a pound
I immediately stop drinking at meals and give up
sugar and sweets absolutely. Yes, even water is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>
tabooed. This all sounds very simple, but, of course,
it precludes much pleasure and relaxation.”</p>

<p>There, mesdames, you have the beauty régime of
a woman who always pleases her public and who possesses
the love and admiration of countless friends.
She is no longer in her girlhood, yet gives not the
faintest indication of maturity. Her figure is slender
and svelte, a succession of soft curves, with not a bone
to disfigure its surface. Her skin is fresh and pink
as a small child’s and her hair shows vigorous health.</p>

<p>While all women may not be beautiful, cleanliness
and fine grooming and an ordinary amount of exercise
will render them most attractive. Stout women should
bathe oftener than lean ones, but let them avoid the
use of hot water; it has a tendency to produce headache
with the full-blooded individual. Always follow
a warm bath with a dash of cold water—it contracts
the pores and inspires circulation. For persons with
weak nerves, sponging is better than tubbing or the
shock of the shower. Cold water must be used with
judgment.</p>

<p>A hot foot bath accompanied by vigorous rubbing
is often beneficial in cases of insomnia. In bathing
be careful to “go beneath the upper layer of the skin,
get down to the underlying tissues,” and give them
the benefit of the friction. The mere exercise attendant
upon rubbing the body is salutary and helps in a great
measure to keep circulation at top notch.</p>

<p>Laxity or downright laziness in home bathing is
one of the sins of the age, though one may not deny
that this century is the apotheosis of cleanliness as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>
compared to the methods adopted by the beauties of
long ago. A flick of the wash rag constituted their
daily ablution, and the weekly bath was looked upon
as a function.</p>

<p>Lean persons should be wary of the Turkish bath,
while the victim of corpulency must avoid the Russian.
The Roman bath, in reality an oil bath, is productive
of flesh, therefore beneficial to badly nourished bodies.
Bathing should never be indulged in directly after
eating and never carried to the point of over-exertion.</p>

<p>After a fatiguing day a woman can do nothing which
will more quickly restore tone to throbbing nerves,
rob strained, tense muscles of their aching weariness,
and refit her for the duties of housekeeper and hostess,
than to take some kind of aromatic bath or to follow
the ordinary warm bath by spraying the whole body
with eau de cologne.</p>

<p>If the head aches, bathe the face in hot, perfumed
water, do it slowly, rubbing the forehead and temples
in a rotary motion and let the hot cloth linger
behind the ears and on the nape of the neck. This
treatment will do as much for you as an hour’s sleep.</p>

<p>A salt rub is also a tonic and should be taken in the
morning, after a tepid bath; take a handful of damp
sea salt and rub it vigorously upon the body. Follow
this with a rapid sponging of the stinging spray.</p>

<p>Oatmeal bags are pleasant and easily prepared.
At home you can make a dozen for the price of one.
They whiten the skin and give it a velvety softness,
besides imparting a delicate fragrance.</p>

<p>Make the bags of cheesecloth, about four inches<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>
square, and fill them loosely with the following mixture:
Five pounds of oatmeal, one pound of powdered
Florentine orris, one pound of almond meal and half a
pound of pure castile soap scraped to a powder. One
bag will be sufficient for a bath.</p>

<h3>THE CARE OF THE HANDS</h3>

<p>Many a woman who gives time and thought to the
art of pleasing, who bemoans natural shortcomings
or physical defects, is unconscious of the power and
fascination that a well-developed and well-cared-for
hand wields in a most subtle fashion. Very often
the soul speaks through the hand when a halting
tongue refuses speech. Conceal natural instincts as
you will, the hands ofttimes betray them. Hide them,
transform them, the hand, still true to nature, defies
your efforts.</p>

<p>Lavater says: “The hand, whether in motion or
repose, has an expression of its own that is not to be
mistaken. When in perfect rest it shows what are
our traits of character; its flexions betray what are
our actions and our passions.” In all ages homage
has been paid to the hand, and its study was held in
honor by the wisest philosophers of ancient Greece.
Italy’s great poet Petrarch confessed that Laura’s
“beautiful hand made captive his heart.”</p>

<p>To the student or one blessed with natural discernment,
the shape, texture, and color of the hand reveal
the secrets of the soul. Good blood and breeding
are to be discovered, and, though the poise of head<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>
and grace of carriage be acquired, the contour of
wrist, palm, and finger remains obstinately natural.</p>

<p>What the mind conceives the hands put into execution,
and what the heart wills the hand makes possible.
Upon the palm are found more or less indications
of the physical and mental attitudes of men—their
appetites, instincts, and ambitions. A narrow palm
suggests feeble temperament, lacking force of imagination,
while too broad a one denotes egotism and
sensuality. A nature capable of great enjoyment
and the possessor of a lively imagination develops a
supple and fairly generous expanse of palm; but the
hard, thick hand ofttimes lacks intelligence.</p>

<p>Knotty fingers, when not the result of gout, indicate
originality; the smooth taper finger means love
of art and a predominance of sentiment over reason.
Square fingers denote method, and the spatulate show
ability, tact, and action. Very rare is the psychic
hand with its slim tapering fingers, its snowy texture
and wonderful softness. Well for the world that it
is uncommon, lacking as it does usefulness and industry.</p>

<p>That the hands are capable of improvement, so far
as texture is concerned, is demonstrated by the secrets
of my lady’s boudoir. There are different exercises
for relaxing and contracting the muscles, which unite
in imparting suppleness and expression. Given over
to contact with everything that can spoil, soil, and
deform them, how shall one keep their beauty? Cleanliness
is the first and most important factor, and pure
castile soap is always reliable, but frequent washings
are unnecessary for softening the skin. The hands<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>
should be washed only when necessary, in neither
very hot nor very cold water. Avoid all extremes of
temperature. Soft water is imperative, however, and
wheat, bran, or almond meal thrown in the basin will
be found beneficial; after which rub the skin with
almond oil, cold cream, or some simple lotion. There
is an old-fashioned but safe method of whitening the
hands. Take some horse chestnuts, peel, dry, and then
pound them in a mortar until they become a fine powder.
A pinch of this flour thrown into a pint of water and
stirred will make it white and milky, a delicious
substitute for soap on a cold day, when the skin is
apt to chap unless great care be given to drying
the hands.</p>

<p>Milk is also marvelous for bleaching, but it is a
luxury not suited to all purses. Lemon juice may
be used to remove stains from the hands. Tomatoes
will produce the same effect. For a stubborn mark,
rub gently with a piece of fine toilet pumice; but beware
of injuring the texture of the skin.</p>

<p>After a thorough cleansing comes the manicuring
of the nails, which with a little experience may be
accomplished at home with excellent results. The
flesh surrounding the nails should be pressed back
very gently to its proper place. Be careful not to tear
or bruise it, else a jagged appearance will result, necessitating
clipping, which always encourages growth.
An orange stick is a necessary adjunct to the toilet; by
its aid the nails can be probed and cleaned without
fear of injury. A white crescent at the base, a rosy
tint in the middle, and a white transparent border with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>
a polished (not too highly) surface are the marks of
well-cared-for nails.</p>

<p>Do not have them too long, else they are liable to
break; curve on either side, with the deepest portion
projecting just far enough to protect the ball of the
finger. Do not scrape with pointed instruments of
steel. It takes a long time for a bruised surface to
resume normal conditions. Gloves, worn when unpleasant
work is necessary, should be loose. Before
putting them on it is a good idea to cover the hands
with a light layer of oil of sweet almonds or vaseline.
This prevents callous spots, and the process of softening
will be in progress during the occupation.</p>

<h3>YOUR “LAUGH” LINES</h3>

<p>It was long the popular belief that wrinkles are
caused chiefly by sorrow and care. Up pops somebody
in this twentieth century to denounce that theory and
to declare that the merry folk are far oftener afflicted
than the sorrowful and that laughter more frequently
furrows the face than tears.</p>

<p>It is a rather happy suggestion; not that wrinkles
are welcome, but that cheerfulness is a heaven-sent
gift and should be received with grateful hearts. Let
laughter ring out loud and long. It is infectious. It
uplifts those who hear it. If it brings wrinkles, you
may be sure it displaces more hideous lines.</p>

<p>If home were made more cheerful, the law would
clutch less often at the throats of criminals and the
institutions would open their doors to fewer refugees.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>
We know, when night comes, mothers are tired and
husbands fractious with bile and business. The good
woman would like to sit down to an interesting book
and the man to his newspaper and silence, each feeling
the comfort is well deserved from duties well performed.</p>

<p>But have they the right and is it safe to follow the
natural bent? Boys and girls will have fun; they
will have room and place for noise and laughter and
the irresponsible bubbling of youthful spirits. If
these be not accorded to them in their home they
will surely seek and find diversion outside.</p>

<p>She is the wise mother who, in addition to her deeper
anxieties and solicitude, draws and holds with her
own largeness of spirit the expanding natures of her
laughing girl and rollicking boy. To do this she must
be as quick to laugh as to cry with them, recognizing
the drollery of their wit and giving it welcome.</p>

<p>There is the cheerful woman who puts herself out
to be pleasant to her friends. Meet her on the street
and she will treat you to a cheery smile and a soft
greeting that has a sweet little melody all its own.
Such a woman makes the nightingales sing in one’s
heart. She doesn’t send souls into deep mourning
as does the whiny woman or the grouchy person or
the suffering sister with woes that bury you like an
avalanche.</p>

<p>Plenty of persons have troubles, but they don’t
shake them out and beat the dust out of them and hang
them up in the air all the time and display them for
the entertainment of their acquaintances. There is
no such thing as being without troubles, and when you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>
run across a woman who gives you a smile and a bright
little word don’t tell yourself that it is easy for her,
that she hasn’t anything to worry about.</p>

<p>One never knows. She may have, all buried in the
depths of her heart, more trouble to the square inch
than you have ever heard about. It doesn’t pay to
be grumpy. Not a bit of it. It doesn’t pay to be a
member of the Tearful Society, either. The only
thing that counts is a brave heart filled to the roof
with simple, honest charity.</p>

<p>You have seen those awful parlors, haven’t you, in
the country districts, where the shades are always
drawn and Mme. Moth has garden parties in every
corner of the carpet and funereal pictures hang from
the wall, and when you open the door you are struck
deaf, dumb, blind, and senseless with the frightful
mustiness that finally chases you out in the free air?</p>

<p>Some persons shut up their hearts just the same
way. Open up the windows. Let sunshine fairies
mob the place. Scatter the moths of mortal mind
helter-skelter and dig out the bad-conscience corners.
You will have a nice, clean, hygienic feeling after your
heart housecleaning.</p>

<p>Suddenly you will find you are having a garden party
there; you will find yourself entertaining beautiful
thoughts, and you will wonder how you ever lived under
the old régime when you displayed so little hospitality.
It is a fine thing to know how to welcome the big feelings
of life. Don’t forget that laughter is a good
tonic and a near-panacea for many ills.</p>

<h3>LOTION FOR THAT “TIRED” FEELING</h3>

<p>Take one-quarter pint of alcohol—the recipe can
be doubled or tripled if desired—one ounce each of
spirits of camphor and ammonia, two and a half ounces
of sea salt and one pint of boiling water; mix thoroughly
and always shake before using. If a woman comes
in tired from a day’s shopping, a long walk, or any
other wearying exertion, apply the tonic to the face
and arms, and it will magically remove all of that
“tired” feeling and put one in fine condition for the
evening.</p>

<p>Another delightful and refreshing bath water, which
is said to come from Portugal, is made from two and
one-half ounces each of eau de rose and eau fleur
d’orange, one and a quarter ounces of eau de myrte,
one-half drachm of essence of ambergris and one-quarter
drachm of essence of musk. After thoroughly
commingling the ingredients, keep closely corked in
a bottle for a week in the dark—it were better if it
remained even two weeks—then pour off the clear
liquid. A little poured into the basin of water in
which the face is washed will revive and freshen the
complexion wonderfully.</p>

<h3>ONE SIDE OF THE FINANCIAL QUESTION
BETWEEN MAN AND WIFE</h3>

<p>The philosophy of clothes is a serious study, and
instead of being frowned upon by men, who invariably
associate it with wild extravagance, it should be incorporated
as first among the bylaws of home life. Women<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>
in many cases are largely responsible for the troubles
and misunderstandings which arise, brought about,
as they often are, on the very threshold of married life.</p>

<p>When a husband admires the stylish appearance
of his bride’s traveling gown she is apt to be tempted
by the irresponsible imp of mischief to answer, “It
cost but a trifle.” In fact, she may burst out with
the fiction that she “never spends money on gowns.”
This small and unnecessary explosion may win her a
tithe of praise at the moment; but it also paves the way
for an embarrassing future if she proposes to live up
to the fairy tale.</p>

<p>It is curious that the most honest, frank, and truthful
women will often hesitate or even fib when asking
for domestic expenses, and the most generous and
loyal fellow in the world, who lives to spend his dollars
like the farmer sows his wheat, looks “concerned,”
to be mild in our expression, when the woman whom
he loves and trusts looks to him for the weekly stipend.</p>

<p>The wife of a millionaire, who never made anything
but her own complexion, boasted that her husband
was under the impression that she designed and made
her own gowns and bonnets. This she had told him
on their wedding journey, and she could never pluck
up courage to undeceive him.</p>

<p>A little honesty at the start would make the financial
side of matrimony much more pleasant; hence it is difficult
to understand why a woman prevaricates when the
broad way of truth is easier—unless, indeed, she be
tied to a man who “rows” every time money is
mentioned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>Perhaps he doesn’t mean it. So few of them understand
that the very need of asking hurts and humiliates,
even grieves, a proud woman.</p>

<p>A fine, jolly man rallied his wife once on her diffidence
in this manner: “Ashamed to come to me for anything?
Nonsense! You can come to me as you go
to God.” And he never realized the supreme egotism
of his speech. So long as she did not smile over it,
all went well.</p>

<p>Women hesitate to discuss unpleasant matters with
their husbands, and at an early stage they are made
to feel that money is an extremely unpleasant subject.
Hence they resort to all sorts of foolish subterfuges to
obtain possession without open speech. This does
not class them among deceivers. A woman is simply
more careful than a man in her methods, fearing she
will give offence.</p>

<p>Nature sets us an example for “all things new.”
She never wears the castaway leaves of past seasons.
There is no remade foliage on the trees, no flaunting
of spring colors in November. The late skies are
veiled in tints the summer never saw and the earth in
her old age is as changeful as a merry maid in her
teens.</p>

<p>The influence of dress is greater than we will acknowledge.
We feel better, act better and bring more
honor to those who love us when we are properly
gowned. An ill-dressed woman may possess the wisdom
of a sage, or the beauty of a goddess; but among
her sisters she is at a tremendous disadvantage unless
she is like unto them in the glory of her raiment.</p>

<h3>DON’TS UP TO DATE</h3>

<p class="center">FOLLOW RULES AND BE HEALTHY AND WISE,
IF NOT OTHERWISE</p>

<p>Don’t exercise after you feel exhausted.</p>

<p>Don’t fail to laugh at your husband’s jokes.</p>

<p>Don’t treat your family to a morning view of hair-curlers.</p>

<p>Don’t neglect the daily bath if you want a radiant
complexion.</p>

<p>Don’t forget that diet, quiet, and sleep are the hand-maidens
of beauty.</p>

<p>Don’t be afraid of sunshine and fresh air; they give
bloom and color.</p>

<p>Don’t wear the high collar. It ruins the line and
curve of the neck and hardens the flesh and often
leaves its mark.</p>

<p>Don’t talk when you are hoarse. Your voice may
be permanently lost or difficulties of the throat result.</p>

<p>Don’t ride in an open carriage or near the open<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>
window of a car after playing golf or exercising in a
vigorous way.</p>

<p>Don’t exercise one part of the body too much and
another not at all. Let the development be symmetrical.</p>

<p>Don’t become so burdened with the accumulation
of knowledge that you cannot spare time for a good
hearty laugh.</p>

<p>Don’t think any “old dress will do for home.”
Always wear a pretty and becoming gown.</p>

<p>Don’t tell your husband you wish you hadn’t married
him. The chances are that you don’t wish it any more
than he does.</p>

<p>Don’t believe you can get rid of wrinkles by filling
in the crevices with powder. Instead, give your face
a warm bath and good scrub, night and morning.</p>

<p>Don’t take a long walk or undertake much household
work before breakfast. Vitality is not at its best early
in the morning. Strength increases as the sun rises
and one is stronger about midday.</p>
